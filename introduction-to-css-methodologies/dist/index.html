# What is CSS Methodologies?

CSS methodologies are formal, documented systems for authoring CSS in a way that allows us to develop, maintain and scale the front-end as a set of small, isolated modules

---

class: page

# What is CSS Methodologies (.cont)

Methodologies for scalable maintainable frontend code, especially CSS

---

class: page

# What is CSS Methodologies (.cont)

Each CSS methodology offers a slightly different set of solutions to the CSS scalability/maintainability problem. A CSS methodology will often define guidelines for:

* CSS and HTML best practices
* Class- and ID-naming conventions
* Ordering and grouping of CSS style rules
* Code formatting

---

class: page

# What is CSS Methodologies (.cont)

There is no __best__ CSS methodology. They are only different __approaches__ to work better for different individuals/teams/projects.

---

class: page

# Why we use it?

We will be easily to design and iterate on your web design projects, regardless of scale and complexity.

# Standard CSS Guidelines

# BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

---

class: page

# BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

BEM stands for Block Element Modifier and originated at Yandex. It provides a rather strict way to arrange your CSS classes into independent modules

---

class: page

# BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

There are a few variations on the idea but the most common one looks like this:

```css
.block {}
.block__element {}
.block--modifier {}
.block__element--modifier {}
```

---

class: page

# BEM - Block

A __Block__ represents an object in your website. For example:

* a person
* a login form
* a menu
* a search form

---

class: page

# BEM - Block (.cont)

Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.

example: `header`, `container`, `menu`, `checkbox`, `input`

---

class: page

# BEM - Element

An __Element__ is a component within the block that performs a particular function. It should only make sense in the context of its block. For example:

* a hand
* a login button
* a menu item
* a search input field

---

class: page

# BEM - Element (.cont)

Parts of a block and have no standalone meaning. They are semantically tied to its block.

example: `menu item`, `list item`, `checkbox caption`, `header title`

---

class: page

# BEM - Modifier

A Modifier is how we represent the variations of a block. For example:

* a female person
* a condensed login form (e.g. we’re hiding the labels in one version)
* a menu modified to look differently for a footer or sitemap
* a search input field with a particular button style

---

class: page

# BEM - Modifier (.cont)

Flags on blocks or elements. Use them to change appearance or behavior.

example: `disabled`, `highlighted`, `checked`, `fixed`, `size big`, ``color yellow`

---

class: page

# BEM Example

In the example of our menu, the class names could look like this:

```css
.menu {}
.menu__item {}
.menu__item--featured {}
.menu--footer {}
```

---

class: page

# BEM Advantages and Guidance

* It is applicable to all projects, big and small
* It avoids nesting
* It helps you rediscover the power of classes
* Makes working on larger sites easier
* The BEM methodology encapsulates your code for reuse
* Works well with frameworks with a component-based focus
* Quick way to deliver prototypes
* Makes you think twice
* Don’t get too strict with it

# SMACSS (Scalable Modular Architecture CSS)

---

class: page

# What is SMACSS?

SMACSS is a CSS framework by Jonathan Snook. On the SMACSS website, he says it is more like a “style guide” than a rigid CSS framework. 

---

class: page

# SMACSS Categories:

SMACSS focuses on five categories for its rules:

* Base
* Layout
* Module
* State
* Theme

---

class: page

# SMACSS - Base

__Base__ is used for defaults like `html`, `body`, `a`, `a:hover`. This includes your CSS resets and would often be in its own base CSS file or at the start of your main CSS.

---

class: page

# SMACSS - Layout

__Layout__ divides a page into sections with elements like header, footer, and article. Often developers show layout elements by prefixing the class with `l-`.

---

class: page

# SMACSS - Module

__Module__ is a reusable, modular element in the design. The SMACSS documentation sees modules as the majority of your elements and thus doesn’t require that you prefix them but you could do so if you choose.

---

class: page

# SMACSS - State

__State__ is used for the variations possible for each element (e.g. active, inactive, expanded, hidden). These are prefixed with `is-`, e.g. `is-active`, `is-inactive`, `is-expanded`, `is-hidden` or are via pseudo-classes such as `:hover` and `:focus` or media queries.

---

class: page

# SMACSS - Theme

__Theme__ is similar to state but defines how modules and layouts will look. It is more applicable for larger sites with shared elements that look different throughout. You would add theme variations on a per page or per section basis.

---

class: page

# SMACSS Advantage and Guidance

* Ease of demonstration and handover
* Good for newcomers to a CSS methodology
* Ease of reading
* Scalable for all projects
* You can use it with BEM!

# OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS)

---

class: page

# OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS)

How do you scale CSS for thousands of pages? Object Oriented CSS is an answer. It’s an approach for writing CSS that’s fast, maintainable, and standards-based. It adds much needed predictability to CSS so that even beginners can participate in writing beautiful websites.

---

class: page

# What is CSS Object

Basically, a CSS “object” is a repeating visual pattern, that can be abstracted into an independent snippet of HTML, CSS, and possibly JavaScript. That object can then be reused throughout a site.

---

class: page

# What is CSS Object (.cont)

For instance, in the OOCSS framework the media object describes a content block containing a fixed-size media element (e.g. image or video) along with other variable-size content (e.g. text). Another example is the module object, which describes a generic content block with a required body area and optional header and footer areas.

---

class: page

# Two Main Principles of OOCSS

* Separate structure and skin
* Separate container and content

---

class: page

# Principles #1 : Separate structure and skin

This means to define repeating visual features (like background and border styles) as separate “skins” that you can mix-and-match with your various objects to achieve a large amount of visual variety without much code.

---

class: page

# Principles #1 : Separate structure and skin (.cont)

Separating structure and skin can also mean using classes to name your objects and their components, rather than relying solely on the semantics of HTML. For example, the media object is named with `class="media"`, and its components are named with `class="img"` (for the image/video component) and `class="bd"` (for the body/text component).

---

class: page

# Principles #2 : Separate container and content

Essentially, this means __rarely use location-dependent styles__. An object should look the same no matter where you put it. So instead of styling a specific `<h2>` with `.myObject h2 {...}`, create and apply a class that describes the `<h2>` in question, like `<h2 class="category">`.

---

class: page

# Principles #2 : Separate container and content (.cont)

This gives you the assurance that:

1. all unclassed `<h2>`s will look the same; 
2. all elements with the category class (called a mixin) will look the same; and 
3. you won’t need to create an override style for the case when you actually do want `.myObject h2` to look like the normal `<h2>`.
